# Annotation_Tweeets_Emotion_Value
Human annotation for gun relevant tweets

The dataset released here is the results of a human annotation effort to identify the emotion and moral value conveyed in tweets relevant to gun issues in the US. There was a total of 3100 tweets being annotated. These tweets were selected from a larger dataset we constructed [github source? from Muheng?] that tracked two groups of Twitter users who were identified in our prior work as either Trump or Clinton supporters in the US 2016 presidential eleciton. We used this distinction as the proxy of ideology difference, considering those tweets composed from Trump supporters as messages from the Conservative camp (Con), and those from Clinton supporters the Liberal camp (Lib). Using keyword methods, we selected all tweets relevant to gun issues from the larger dataset [keywords? github source? from Muheng?]. Among the selected 3100 gun relevant tweets, there are 1322 from Con and 1778 from Lib.
